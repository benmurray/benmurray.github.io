I think I am going to live out loud for a while. This is a pelican based website and here is how I
update the theme (Flex)

I need to make changes in my clone of Flex. (I stored mine in ~/scratch/Flex) Then I need to run:

.. code-block:: console

    $pelican-themes -r Flex

    $pelican-themes -i ~/scratch/Flex

Then I:

.. code-block:: console

    $make html

    $make github

And that's it for now.
